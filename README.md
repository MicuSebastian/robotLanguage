# robotLanguage
This project aims to write an interpreter for the Robot language. The language is used to move a robot on a flat surface. The robot can move forward, backward, turn or jump. An interpreter is written that receives as parameter a file with commands and writes on the screen the position and rotation of the robot after each command.
