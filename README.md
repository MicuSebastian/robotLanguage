# The Position of the Robot

The robot has a position and a rotation. The position is represented by a pair (x, y) expressed using integers. The rotation of the robot is expressed in degrees and varies between 0 and 360. The state of the robot is expressed by (x, y, r), which means: * x, y the position * r the rotation in degrees

# Starting point

The robot starts from (0, 0, 90) whose position is (0, 0) and rotation is 90 degrees.
